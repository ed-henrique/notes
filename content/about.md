:rocket: Student and developer, I started programming at the age of 16, creating my own scripts in Python.

:books: I started college at 18 and got my first job as a developer at 21. I'm always looking to share the knowledge I've gained throughout this journey.

:mortar_board: I graduated in Digital Marketing from Claretiano, stepping out of the tech comfort zone, but bringing very relevant experiences for my growth in frontend development.

:jigsaw: Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at UFRR and working as a developer for the Government of Roraima, always seeking to expand my knowledge and gain new experiences in the programming world.
